<h1>Newsery</h1>
<p>Hello! Welcome to Newsery's git.<br>
  This is a completely free project created for fun. Anyone is free to contribute without any requirement.<br>
  For more details see the information below.</p>
<h2>Purpose of the project</h2>
<p>We all know Wordpress one of the most used CMS. But Wordpress has a problem: slowness.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project, in addition to trying something new, is also to create a cleaner and lighter CMS that allows everyone to have the convenience of a CMS with the speed of a site built on purpose.</p>
<h2>Who can contribute?</h2>
<p>All! There are no rules that allow only a small group of people to contribute.</p>
<p>But be careful, there are rules to avoid problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requests will be processed in order of time (FIFO: First In First Out)</li>
  <li>The code must not contain bugs known to the developer or must not break the program.</li>
  <li>Your code will be accepted after reviewing the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first rule can only be avoided if the request deals with an open bug in the issue section or a bug that compromises security.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>If you are interested in chatting with other developers or just to see what is being discussed you can come to our discord (there is even the radiobot): link here</p>
